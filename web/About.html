            <br><br><br><br>&ThickSpace;&ThickSpace;&ThickSpace; Rolex, a renowned Swiss watch brand, was founded in 1905 by Hans Wilsdorf and Alfred Davis in 
            London under the name Wilsdorf & Davis. In 1908, the brand name “Rolex” was registered. 
            The company moved to Geneva, Switzerland, in 1919 due to economic challenges in the UK.
